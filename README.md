# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About this project

This is a simple little project that will retreive the weather and reccomend what to wear according to said weather. This has now gone from showing weather in one city to being able to search up whatever city on earth you want and get data :D

## 01/19/2024:

UPDATE RELEASED FOR FRONT END AUTHENTICATION: This app now utilizes logging in and out as well as having an account and item functions run with token functionality. In other words
a valid token is needed to be logged in and to stay logged in as well as validating functionality with other users cards  

## 09/07/2024:
MAJOR UPDATE BEING WORKED ON: This update is almost done as a matter of fact, all that needs to be completed is the new weather card and formatting things more to the mobile sizes. This update
enables the user to lookup any city in the world and return information on that rather than just being stuck on one city. Still works fast and creates a more engaging user experience.

PROTOTYPE RELEASED!: This is a demo for the new version of this project which is now responsive. This is still a demo because I need to update the back-end and fix some
errors on that and I still want to make the UI better as it was challenging fitting information down to 320px

Demonstration(s):
