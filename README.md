# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About this project

This is a simple little project that will retreive the weather and reccomend what to wear according to said weather. MOBILE VERSION WILL BE COMING SOON!
This project is my first attempt at building an app using React.js and working with JSX Syntax!

## 01/19/2024:

UPDATE RELEASED FOR FRONT END AUTHENTICATION: This app now utilizes logging in and out as well as having an account and item functions run with token functionality. In other words
a valid token is needed to be logged in and to stay logged in as well as validating functionality with other users cards

## Technologies Used:

- React.js
- JSX
- Backend development coming soon!
- Cuurently optimized for desktop but responsive design will follow shortly
- COMING SOON -> WeatherCard will be dynamic depending on conditions!
