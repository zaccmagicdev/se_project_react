# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About this project

This is a simple little project that will retreive the weather and reccomend what to wear according to said weather. MOBILE VERSION WILL BE COMING SOON!
This project is my first attempt at building an app using React.js and working with JSX Syntax!

## 01/19/2024:

UPDATE RELEASED FOR FRONT END AUTHENTICATION: This app now utilizes logging in and out as well as having an account and item functions run with token functionality. In other words
a valid token is needed to be logged in and to stay logged in as well as validating functionality with other users cards

## 09/07/2024:
MAJOR UPDATE BEING WORKED ON: This update is almost done as a matter of fact, all that needs to be completed is the new weather card and formatting things more to the mobile sizes. This update
enables the user to lookup any city in the world and return information on that rather than just being stuck on one city. Still works fast and creates a more engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used:

- freeWeatherAPI | Improved API for this site's criterias. Features the ability to customize the API call to lookup any city without coordinates and simply just the name
- React.js
- JSX
- Backend development coming soon!
- Cuurently optimized for desktop but responsive design will follow shortly
- COMING SOON -> WeatherCard will be dynamic depending on conditions!
